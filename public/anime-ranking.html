  alt="A large skinless humanoid moinster called a Titan looking over a 50 metre wall down on the protagonist. The protagonist wears a brown jacket, cargo pants and a sword on either side of his belt. He also has a machine that shoots cables to swing on and that same machine also has gas for propulsion. The titan is all red muscles and has no skin as described. It's sunset, everyuthing is warm and dark and orange."

  This is my favourite anime. I love how they manage to capture the essence of
  humanity's political existence by creating a species above humans in the food
  chain- The Titans. Lot's of gore, pain, tears and raw acceptance of the
  cyclical nature of our lives, of the survival of the fittest. It's a satire
  and probably one of the best ever made!!!

<h3>Tokyo Ghoul</h3>

  I think I have a knack for mythical creatures. This is the first such anime I
  watched about a species called ghouls which roam present day Tokyo and feast
  on humans. It's dark, gory, psycvhological but ultimately existential. It
  makes one question what's wrong or right when both parties (humans vs. ghouls)
  of similar intelligence are simply trying to exist peacefully and survive
  while staying true to their nature. A situation where there's never going to
  be a scope of peace. I feel it's about human existence, how there's no right
  and wrong after a point and how we aren't sure of what's above us as a
  species, what has m,ade us and why we are the way we are. p>

<h3>Death Note</h3>

  alt="A demon with black spoiky hair, emaciated body wearing victorian era black clothes(corsets the wway women used to wear. His eyes are round and bulging with red pupils, his lips are black and his teeth are sharp triangles. Beneath him is a young adult male with rust colored hair who is tall, fair and clean shaven. He sports an evil expression in his eyes and a smirk. In his hand is a notebook titled Death Note.)"

  This was the first anime I watched as a late teenager. It's dark, intense and
  psychological, revolving around a magic notebook called Death Note that has
  fallen to earth from the Demon realm. If someone's name is written in it, the
  said person dies. The story is about the fine balance of morality, when the
  protagonist turns into a villain. A must watch for anyone on earth (as long as
  you're above 13-14 years old.)
