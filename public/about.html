  My name is Aditya Kumar Chatterjee. I am interested in understanding reality
  hence most things interest me. Things which don't have Truth (with a capital
  T) don't interest me, be it conversations, people, movies, painting, music,
  books etc. I love nature and prefer spending time around trees with my feet
  planted in the soil. I like feeling strong and capable, which is why I'm
  currently learning how to code. I recently started to do cold showers (it's
  winter season here, temperatures ranging from 4-18 degrees centigrate.). I
  have done my undergrad in Product Design but due to not being sufficiently
  mature back then to make the most of it , I misused my time by chasing
  pleasures and illusions. I regret that till date. This lead to poor marks
  throughout college and ultimately no work after college. I worked but only in
  the company of a family member (that too for only 6 months or so, I was phased
  out of the company. They reduced contact and ultimate3ly ceased all forms of
  communication. Quite sad, I know :( ). Even the opportunity was brought to me
  by my father. I have failed to secure a single job as of now. But it's not
  like I'm a hollow creature or that I didnt have life changing revelations
  during these past 3 years. I believe it was important for me to feel so lost
  and remain home in order to accept my reality. I also realised that I had been
  avoiding hard work and have an avoidant personality disorder. Or avoidant
  attachment disorder idk. By nature I'm quite chaotic but when I focus my
  energies I can create an outstanding degree of order. It makes me question
  whether I'm chaotic or orderly.

  I used to paint in my free time but that stopped. Could be because of several
  reasons. My main motivator used to be social media and receiving attention.
  Now that I've phased out of it, mky motivation to pursue it has plummetted
  alongside. However, my creativity has found a newer outlet- through design
  technology. I realised it's all the same to me. Art and technology. Maybe
  there wouldn't be a complete overlap[ if we were to draw venn diagrams but for
  the mopst bit I've realised that I am the way I am and therefore I will
  function only in one way as long as I wish to remain sane. I will approach
  everything including art, technology and de4sign or even physical health and
  spirituality in the same way. It's not possible to become different. If I do,
  I usually try to see3 if the different behaviour is a resultant of me
  suppressing myself or due to me discovering a little bit more about myself :D

  Anyway, I shall leave this at that and I hope to write more comprehensively
  about my feelings in the future. Until then, <br />
  Sayo-Nara!
